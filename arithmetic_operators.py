# Addition
print(x + y)  # 13

# Substraction
print(x - y)  # 7

# Multiplication
print(x * y)  # 30

# Division
print(x / y)  # 3.333..

# Floor Division - returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division
print(x // y)  # 3

# Modulus - return reminder after devision
print(x % y)  # 1

# Power
print(x**y)  # 1000
